## Your feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework? 25 hours or more.

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?  

 The homework was very challenging and it was stressful to have it in the final week. I wish we could have that any other time. But it was actually really interesting, but it took us forever to get it conceptually and it was even harder to code, because we had to read so much and figure out what we need to use and what not.
